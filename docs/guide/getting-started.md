# Getting Started

Milkdown is a lightweight but powerful WYSIWYG markdown editor. It consists of two parts:

-   A tiny core which provides a plugin loader and all kinds of internal plugins.
-   Lots of additional plugins provide syntax, commands and components.

With this pattern you can enable or disable any custom syntax and feature you like, such as table, latex and tooltip. You can also create your own plugin to support your awesome idea.

> 🍼 Fun fact: The Milkdown documentation is rendered by milkdown.

# First editor

Basically, you have 2 ways to create an editor:

1. Use the `@milkdown/kit` to build your own editor from scratch.
2. Use the `@milkdown/crepe`, which is a well-configured editor that works out of the box.

## Use `@milkdown/kit`

First, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install @milkdown/kit @milkdown/theme-nord
```

Then, create a simple editor with the commonmark syntax:

```typescript
import { Editor } from '@milkdown/kit/core';
import { commonmark } from '@milkdown/kit/preset/commonmark';

import { nord } from '@milkdown/theme-nord';
import '@milkdown/theme-nord/style.css';

Editor
  .make()
  .config(nord)
  .use(commonmark)
  .create();
```

Now let's add **undo & redo** support to our editor using the `history` plugin:

```typescript
import { Editor } from '@milkdown/kit/core';
import { commonmark } from '@milkdown/kit/preset/commonmark';
import { history } from '@milkdown/kit/plugin/history';

import { nord } from '@milkdown/theme-nord';
import '@milkdown/theme-nord/style.css';

const milkdown = Editor
  .make()
  .config(nord)
  .use(commonmark)
  .use(history)
  .create()
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Editor created');
  });

// To destroy the editor
milkdown.destroy();
```

> `<Mod>` is `<Cmd>` for mac and `<Ctrl>` for other platforms.

Now we can undo an edit by using `<Mod-z>` and redo it by using `<Mod-y>/<Shift-Mod-Z>`.

## Use `@milkdown/crepe`

First, install the required package:

```bash
npm install @milkdown/crepe
```

Then, create the crepe editor.

```typescript
import { Crepe } from '@milkdown/crepe';
import "@milkdown/crepe/theme/common/style.css";

// We have some themes for you to choose
// available themes: frame, classic, nord, frame-dark, classic-dark, nord-dark
import "@milkdown/crepe/theme/frame.css";

const crepe = new Crepe({
    root: document.getElementById('app'),
    defaultValue: 'Hello, Milkdown!',
});

crepe.create().then(() => {
  console.log('Editor created');
});

// To destroy the editor
crepe.destroy();
```
