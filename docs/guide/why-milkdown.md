# Why Milkdown

There are different kinds of markdown editors, such as [Typora](https://typora.io/), [tui](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor) and [Bear](https://bear.app/).
They work pretty well for writing notes in markdown on different platforms. So why bother making Milkdown?

Milkdown aims to provide a **open source solution** for developers to make their editors more powerful, and attractive, it also makes sure it runs everywhere.

## Open Source & Easy to Integrate

Different from industrial apps such as [Notion](https://notion.so) and [Typora](https://typora.io/),
Milkdown is open source and fully free. You can integrate it everywhere legally.

## Plugin Driven

Milkdown treats every feature as a plugin.
With this pattern, developers can choose what they need in an editor instead of bundling all features even they won't need.
Developers can extend their plugins to satisfy their habits such as defining a vim keymap via a custom plugin.

## Reliable

Milkdown is powered by [Prosemirror](https://prosemirror.net/) and [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark), which has a large community and stands the test of the industry.
What's more, plugins from the prosemirror and remark community can be easily reused in order to build a Milkdown plugin.

## Themable & Hackable

Themes and plugins for Milkdown can be shared and installed using npm packages. Milkdown is a headless component, which means you can fully control its style.
