You're seeing this editor called **ü•ûCrepe**, which is an editor built on top of Milkdown.

If you want to install this editor, you can run `npm install @milkdown/crepe`. Then you can use it like this:

```js
import { Crepe } from "@milkdown/crepe";
import "@milkdown/crepe/theme/common/style.css";
// We have some themes for you to choose, ex.
import "@milkdown/crepe/theme/frame.css";

// Or you can create your own theme
import "./your-theme.css";

const crepe = new Crepe({
  root: "#app",
  defaultValue: "# Hello, Milkdown!",
});

crepe.create().then(() => {
  console.log("Milkdown is ready!");
});

// Before unmount
crepe.destroy();
```

## Structure

> üçº [Milkdown][repo] is a WYSIWYG markdown editor framework.
>
> Which means you can build your own markdown editor with Milkdown.

In the real world, a typical milkdown editor is built on top of 3 layers:

- [x] ü•õ Core: The core of Milkdown, which provides the plugin loading system with the editor concepts.
- [x] üßá Plugins: A set of plugins that can be used to extend the functionalities of the editor.
- [x] üçÆ Components: Some headless components that can be used to build your own editor.

At the start, you may find it hard to understand all these concepts.
But don't worry, we have this `@milkdown/crepe` editor for you to get started quickly.
