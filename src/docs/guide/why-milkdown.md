# Why Milkdown

There are kinds of different markdown editors, such as [Typora](https://typora.io/), [tui](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor) and [Bear](https://bear.app/).
They work pretty well for writing notes in markdown on different platforms. So why bother making Milkdown?

Milkdown aims to provide a **open source solution** for developers to make their editors more powerful, attractive, and can be used everywhere.

## Plugin Driven

Milkdown treats every features as plugins.
With this pattern, developers can choose what they need in an editor instead of bundle all features even they won't need.
Developers can extends the plugin to satisfy their habit such as define a vim keymap plugin.

What's more, plugins in prosemirror and remark community can be easily reused to build a Milkdown plugin.

## Themable & Hackable

Themes and plugins for Milkdown can be shared and installed using npm packages. Milkdown is an headless component, which meas you can fully control the style.
